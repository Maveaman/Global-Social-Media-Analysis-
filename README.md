**Global Social Media Analysis â€“ Power BI Dashboard Project**

**Overview**
This project, titled *Global Social Media Analysis*, is a data-driven initiative created to understand the impact of social media usage on various aspects of human life across different countries. Developed independently using tools such as Microsoft Power BI, Excel, DAX, and Power Query, the project aims to explore how social media influences mental health, age-based behavior, relationship quality, and platform preferences. The analysis presents key metrics including average usage time, addiction rates, age demographics, emotional well-being, and the comparative influence of platforms by country.

**Project Objective**
The objective of this project is to educate and inform stakeholders about the growing effects of social media on modern societies. It seeks to provide insights into behavioral trends, highlight areas of concern such as increased screen time and its mental health implications, and identify patterns of usage based on age, geography, and platform type. This analysis is particularly beneficial for digital marketers, behavioral researchers, healthcare professionals, educators, and data analysts who are seeking actionable insights in the digital behavior domain.

**Tools and Technologies Used**
This project was executed using the following tools and technologies:

* Microsoft Excel: Used for collecting and initially cleaning the raw datasets.
* Power Query: Used for advanced data transformation and shaping prior to analysis.
* Power BI: Used for building interactive dashboards and visual storytelling.
* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for creating calculated measures, aggregations, and key performance indicators within Power BI.

These tools were used in combination to process data efficiently, derive meaningful insights, and present them in a visually engaging format.

**Insights and Metrics Explored**
The analysis focuses on the following areas:

* Average daily hours users spend on social media.
* Addiction levels based on user engagement and screen time patterns.
* Age-wise breakdown of social media usage.
* Emotional and mental health indicators related to excessive use.
* Frequency and nature of social conflicts linked to online behavior.
* Comparative platform usage across countries.
* Influence of social media on relationships, health, and sleep cycles.

These insights were derived from structured datasets and were visualized through charts, graphs, and filters to enable dynamic exploration.

**Advantages and Limitations**
One of the strengths of this project lies in its comprehensive and interactive visualizations, which allow for detailed user exploration. The use of Power BI ensures real-time filtering, professional design, and clear communication of insights. Furthermore, by combining both qualitative and quantitative factors, the analysis delivers a holistic understanding of the digital landscape.

However, the project also has a few limitations. The data used is based on publicly available sources and may contain regional gaps or limitations due to self-reporting biases. Moreover, while strong correlations are shown between variables such as mental health and social media use, this project does not claim to establish direct causality.

**Usefulness and Impact**
This dashboard offers valuable insights that can be used to inform public health initiatives, guide responsible digital marketing strategies, and support academic research. It highlights critical trends and challenges that come with rising social media consumption. Whether one is a policymaker aiming to shape digital well-being policies or a researcher looking to understand behavioral trends, this project provides a meaningful foundation for informed decision-making.

**Instructions for Use**
Users can open the Power BI file and interact with various filters such as country, age group, platform type, and gender to explore customized insights. Hovering over visual elements allows users to examine precise values and trends.

**Feedback and Collaboration**
Feedback is welcome and encouraged to help improve future versions of this project. I am also open to collaboration opportunities or data discussions with professionals and peers interested in digital behavior analysis.
